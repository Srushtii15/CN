step 1:make one folder as TCP_File_Transfer

step 2:server.py file in the folder 

import socket

def receive_file():
    # Create TCP socket
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket.bind(('127.0.0.1', 5001))
    server_socket.listen(1)
    print("Server listening on port 5001...")

    # Accept client connection
    conn, addr = server_socket.accept()
    print(f"Connection from {addr}")

    # Step 1: Receive hello from client
    client_hello = conn.recv(1024).decode()
    print(f"Client says: {client_hello}")

    # Step 1: Send hello to client
    conn.send("Hello from Server!".encode())

    # Step 2: Receive file name
    filename = conn.recv(1024).decode()
    print(f"Receiving file: {filename}")

    # Step 2: Receive file data and save it
    with open("received_" + filename, 'wb') as f:
        while True:
            data = conn.recv(1024)
            if not data:
                break
            f.write(data)

    print("File received successfully.")
    conn.close()
    server_socket.close()

# Run the server
receive_file()

step 3:same client.py in same folder

import socket 

def send_file(file_path): 
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    client_socket.connect(('127.0.0.1', 5001))

    # Step 1: Send hello to server 
    client_socket.send("Hello from Client!".encode())

    # Step 1: Receive hello from server 
    server_hello = client_socket.recv(1024).decode() 
    print(f"Server says: {server_hello}")

    # Step 2: Send file name 
    filename = file_path.split('/')[-1]
    client_socket.send(filename.encode())

    # Step 2: Send file data 
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        while True:
            bytes_read = f.read(1024)
            if not bytes_read:
                break
            client_socket.send(bytes_read)

    print("File sent successfully.")
    client_socket.close()

# Run the client 
send_file("test.txt")  # Make sure test.txt exists

Step 4: Create a text file named test.txt in the same folder.
(Example content: Hello, this is a test file for TCP transfer.)

step 5:open cmd change the path to server file  path and paste this "python server.py"
//output:Server listening on port 5001...
 
Connection from ('127.0.0.1', 56789)
Client says: Hello from Client!
Receiving file: test.txt
File received successfully.

step 6: again open cmd change the path to client file path and paste this"python client.py"
//Server says: Hello from Server!
File sent successfully.
